## The Claim

_Composable Future_ is a coined term for a structure not currently named in the literature.

The central claim: **paradigmatic futures have the algebraic properties of composable types.** They can be combined without either being destroyed, sequenced without loss of identity, and the result of composition is itself a valid future that can be further composed.

This is distinct from:

- _Convergence_ — which implies two things merging into one fixed outcome
- _Futures studies_ — which models scenarios qualitatively, not algebraically
- `Future<T>` in async programming — which operates on computations, not paradigms

---

## Core Definition

A Future `F` is a 3-tuple (v0.2):

```
F = (S₀, τ, S₁)
```

| Symbol | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `S₀`   | Current paradigmatic state — existing assumptions, constraints, infrastructure |
| `τ`    | Trajectory — the mechanism of change                                           |
| `S₁`   | Reachable paradigmatic state                                                   |

`Φ` is **derived**, not stored: `F.Φ = AffordanceSet F.S₁ = { G | G.S₀ = F.S₁ }` — the set of all futures reachable from `S₁`. This matches the paper’s definition Φ : S₁ → 𝒫(F) and eliminates the universe mismatch present in v0.1.

---

## Operators

Four primitive operations over futures:

```
A >>= B    sequential    A's S₁ becomes B's S₀
A ⊗ B      parallel      both proceed; outputs combined
A | B      fork          branch point — one path realized
A ⊕ B      merge         two independent futures reconverge
```

---

## Laws Under Investigation

**Identity**

```
F >>= Id = F
Id >>= F = F
```

Where `Id` is the null future — a transition that changes nothing.

**Associativity**

```
(A >>= B) >>= C  =  A >>= (B >>= C)
```

\*Status: **Endpoint-extraction version proved; substantive version open.\***

- **Endpoint-extraction associativity** (`Laws.seqBind_endpoint_assoc`,
  `Stateless.assoc_stateless_endpoint`, `IndexedFuture.endpoint_assoc`):
  proved by `rfl`. The v0.1 `seqBind` extracts only `F.τ.source` and
  `H.τ.target`, so associativity is the trivial fact that endpoint pairing
  is associative — not that paradigm trajectories compose associatively.
- **Weak form** (`WeakAssoc.weak_assoc_affordance`,
  `WeakAssoc.weak_assoc_states`): affordance-level and state-level
  equivalence-up-to. These are honest as stated.
- **Substantive (path-composing) associativity**: open Phase 2 work.
  Requires `Trajectory` to carry an internal path so `seqBind` actually
  concatenates trajectory data. The proof would then follow from
  `List.append_assoc`. See `proofs/notes.md` §"Open: Substantive
  Associativity" for the sketch.

**Commutativity of parallel**

```
A ⊗ B ≠ B ⊗ A   (in general)
```

_Status: **Structurally witnessed; strict ≠ conditional.**_

- **Structural witness** (`Laws.parTensor_component_order`): proved — the component order is opposite in `A ⊗ B` vs `B ⊗ A`.
- **Key reduction** (`Laws.parTensor_comm_implies_prod_comm`): proved — if `parTensor` were commutative then all type products would commute.
- **Conditional existential** (`Laws.parTensor_not_comm_of_type_ne`): proved — given `(A×B) ≠ (B×A)`, specific non-commuting futures exist.
- **Unconditional** `∃ F G, parTensor F G ≠ parTensor G F`: **open** — requires `Prod.type_inj` (type-constructor injectivity), which is sound but not an explicit Lean 4 axiom. See `docs/adr/0003-noncommutativity-strategy.md`.

**Closure**

```
∀ A, B ∈ F :  A >>= B ∈ F
```

Any composition of valid futures is itself a valid future.

## Structural Targets

| Structure        | Condition                          | Status                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Category         | Identity + associativity + closure | Plausible               |
| Monoid           | Category + single object           | Under investigation     |
| Monad            | Monoid + `return` + associativity  | Requires Phase 2        |
| Fibered category | Path-dependent `τ`                 | If associativity breaks |

## Relationship to Existing Formalisms

| Formalism                      | Role in this theory                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Category theory                | Backbone — objects, morphisms, composition             |
| Process algebra (CSP/CCS)      | Formal semantics for `⊗`, `                            | `, `⊕` |
| Modal / temporal logic (CTL\*) | Grounding `S₁` as a distribution over reachable states |
| Coalgebra                      | State-transition structure per future                  |
| Affordance theory              | Formal definition of `Φ`                               |
| Dependent type theory          | `Φ` as a dependent type over `S₁`                      |

## Foundational Audit

Before the positioning paper, a structured audit of the five adjacent literatures:

| Domain                                        | Source                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1. Category theory applied to complex systems | arXiv math.CT, cs.LO        |
| 2. Formal models of paradigm change           | PhilPapers, Google Scholar  |
| 3. Process algebra and concurrent systems     | ACM DL, arXiv cs.LO         |
| 4. Affordance theory — formal treatments      | Google Scholar, PsycINFO    |
| 5. Futures studies formalization              | Google Scholar, arXiv cs.AI |

Each domain file produces:

- A list of relevant papers with relevance notes
- A one-paragraph synthesis of what exists
- A one-sentence gap statement
- A confidence level: gap confirmed / partial / unclear

The `gap-summary.md` aggregates all five into the composite gap statement that opens the positioning paper.

### Running the Audit Search

First install dependencies: `uv sync` (or `pip install -e .`)

```bash
uv run search.py all     # search all 5 domains
uv run search.py 3       # single domain
```

### Refinement Passes

```bash
uv run refinement.py list          # show defined refinements per domain
uv run refinement.py 4 --seeds    # add manual seeds only
uv run refinement.py 4 --queries  # run refined queries only
uv run refinement.py 4            # both
```

Results are written to `audit/domain-N-*.md`. Synthesis sections are filled manually after reading.

### Phase 5 progress

| ADR      | Task                                                              | Status                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ADR-0004 | Upgrade placeholder `PMF` to Mathlib’s real `PMF`                 | ✅ done (2026-05-07)               |
| ADR-0003 | Non-commutativity of ⊗                                            | 🟡 conditional result (2026-05-08) |
| ADR-0002 | Add `path` field to `Trajectory`; prove substantive associativity | ⏳ pending collaborator            |

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **arXiv submission** — Find math.CT or cs.LO endorser (submission ID 7444737, endorsement code NBFD6A)
2. **ADR-0002 — Trajectory enrichment** (8 files, ~200 lines; one-way door; requires Lean collaborator)
   - Add `path : List ParadigmaticState` to `Trajectory`
   - Redefine `seqBind` to concatenate paths
   - Prove substantive associativity via `List.append_assoc`
3. **ADR-0003 gap** — Supply `(A×B) ≠ (B×A)` for some concrete types to close the unconditional existential
   - Three forward paths documented in `docs/adr/0003-noncommutativity-strategy.md`

---

## Open Problems

**OP1: Associativity under path-dependence** ✅ **RESOLVED**

- Endpoint-extraction associativity: `Laws.seqBind_endpoint_assoc` (proved by `rfl`)
- Indexed monad construction: `IndexedFuture.endpoint_assoc` via graded monad
- Weak form: `WeakAssoc.weak_assoc_affordance` (affordance-level FutureEquiv)

**OP2: Is Φ well-defined before S₁ is realized?** ✅ **RESOLVED** (v0.2)

- `AffordanceSet S := setOf fun F => F.S₀ = S` is defined for every S by set comprehension
- `affordanceSet_nonempty`: always non-empty (contains `idFuture S`)
- `affordanceSet_contains_id`: identity future is always in the affordance set

**OP4: Does composition of affordance sets Φ ∘ Φ' hold?** ✅ **RESOLVED** (v0.2)

- `seqBind_Φ_eq`: `(F >>= G).Φ = G.Φ` (proved by `rfl`)
- `seqBind_mem_affordanceSet`: sequential composition is closed in `AffordanceSet F.S₀`
- `composeSequential_mem` / `composeParallel_mem`: descriptor-based witnesses

**Remaining open problems:**

3. **Non-commutativity (strict)** — unconditional `∃ F G, parTensor F G ≠ parTensor G F` requires `Prod.type_inj`. Conditional result proved; three forward paths in ADR-0003.
4. **Equivalence relation** — what is the correct equivalence between futures — bisimulation, SMC isomorphism? (Phase 5)
5. **Completeness** — are all paradigmatic futures reachable by finite composition? (Phase 5)

See `audit/gap-summary.md` for detailed problem statements and `proofs/notes.md` for internal open problems (OP8–OP17).
