**What this phase produces:**
A Lean 4 file that type-checks with `sorry` placeholders for unproved theorems.
Every `sorry` is an explicit open problem. No vague mathematics allowed.

### P1.1 — Lean 4 Setup

  - `  constraints : Type`
  - `  infrastructure : Type`

- [x] 🔴 Define `AffordanceSet` in Lean

### P1.3 — Operators

- [x] 🔴 Define sequential bind `>>=`
  - `def seqBind (F G : ComposableFuture) : ComposableFuture`
  - Requires: `F.S₁ = G.S₀`
  - Returns: future from `F.S₀` to `G.S₁`

- [x] 🔴 Define parallel tensor `⊗`
  - `def parTensor (F G : ComposableFuture) : ComposableFuture`
  - Both proceed; affordance sets combined
  - Type: product of affordances

- [x] 🔴 Define fork `|`
  - `def fork (F G : ComposableFuture) : ComposableFuture`
  - Branch point — one path realized
  - Type: sum/coproduct of affordances

- [x] 🔴 Define merge `⊕`
  - `def merge (F G : ComposableFuture) : ComposableFuture`
  - Two independent futures reconverge
  - Requires: compatible target states

- [x] 🔴 Define identity future `Id`
  - `def idFuture (S : ParadigmaticState) : ComposableFuture`
  - Null transition — changes nothing

### P1.4 — Laws (Typed, Proofs as sorry)

## PHASE 2 — Stateless Associativity Proof
> Gate: associativity proved or disproved for stateless case (τ path-independent)
> Status: not started
> Estimated effort: 2–4 months solo

**What this phase produces:**
Either a Lean proof of `assoc_stateless`, or a formal counterexample
showing associativity breaks. Both outcomes resolve Open Problem 1.

### P2.1 — Formal Setup

- [ ] 🔴 Define `isStateless` predicate for trajectories
  - `τ` is stateless if it does not depend on the history of prior transitions
  - Precise definition required before any proof attempt

- [ ] 🔴 Restrict `ComposableFuture` to stateless case
  - Define `StatelessFuture` as subtype of `ComposableFuture`
  - Prove all operators close over `StatelessFuture`

- [ ] 🔴 Map stateless case to existing CT literature
  - If stateless: F is a category (objects = states, morphisms = futures)
  - Identify which category axioms are already proved by P1 laws

### P2.2 — Proof Attempt

- [ ] 🔴 Write informal proof sketch in `proofs/stateless-case.md`
  - Attempt equational reasoning: unfold definitions both sides
  - Identify what `S₁` compatibility condition associativity requires

- [ ] 🔴 Attempt Lean proof of `assoc_stateless`
  - Start by unfolding `seqBind` definition
  - Check if trajectory composition is definitionally associative
  - If not: identify the obstruction precisely

- [ ] 🔴 Document all dead ends in `proofs/attempt-associativity.md`
  - Every failed proof attempt is data
  - The obstruction may be the key theoretical finding

### P2.3 — Indexed Monad Route (if direct proof fails)

- [ ] 🟡 Study Orchard et al. 2014 — indexed monad construction
  - Does their indexed monad framework apply to trajectory-indexed composition?
  - Lean 4 has Mathlib support for indexed structures

- [ ] 🟡 Define `IndexedFuture` — future indexed by trajectory type
  - `structure IndexedFuture (τ : TrajectoryType) where ...`
  - Associativity may hold in the indexed setting even when it breaks generally

- [ ] 🟡 Prove indexed associativity
  - `theorem indexed_assoc (F G H : IndexedFuture τ) : ...`

### P2.4 — Gate Check

- [ ] 🔴 Outcome documented: proof OR counterexample OR indexed resolution
- [ ] 🔴 `proofs/stateless-case.md` contains full readable proof argument
- [ ] 🔴 Lean file updated: `sorry` either filled or replaced with `sorry` + counterexample note
- [ ] 🟡 Level 1 paper drafted (8–12 pages, targets ACT 2027 or similar venue)

---

## PHASE 3 — Probabilistic Extension
> Gate: Kleisli category construction over probability monad, verified in Lean
> Status: not started
> Estimated effort: 3–6 months (may require collaborator)

**What this phase produces:**
τ : S₀ → 𝒫(S₁) as a Markov kernel. Composition via Kleisli.
Connects the theory to Furter et al. (2025) machinery.

### P3.1 — Mathematical Setup

- [ ] 🔴 Study Kleisli category construction in Mathlib
  - Locate `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Monad.Kleisli`
  - Understand how Mathlib defines monadic bind

- [ ] 🔴 Define probability monad over paradigmatic states
  - `def ProbMonad : Monad ParadigmaticState`
  - Trajectory becomes: `τ : S₀ → Measure S₁`

- [ ] 🔴 Define Kleisli composition for probabilistic trajectories
  - `def kleisliBind (τ₁ : S₀ → Measure S₁) (τ₂ : S₁ → Measure S₂) : S₀ → Measure S₂`
  - This is standard Markov kernel composition

### P3.2 — Connection to Furter et al.

- [ ] 🟡 Map Furter et al.'s SMC of design problems to ComposableFuture
  - Their morphisms = open systems → can paradigmatic trajectories be modeled as open systems?
  - Document mapping in `proofs/notes.md`

- [ ] 🟡 Define change-of-base construction
  - From deterministic ComposableFuture to probabilistic via monad morphism
  - Proves probabilistic extension is conservative

### P3.3 — Lean Formalization

- [ ] 🔴 Implement `lean/Core/Probabilistic.lean`
  - Remove stub, add full Kleisli construction
  - Prove Kleisli composition is associative (this holds — standard result)

- [ ] 🔴 State and prove probabilistic identity law
  - `theorem prob_left_identity : kleisliBind (pure ∘ id) τ = τ`

- [ ] 🔴 State and prove Kleisli associativity
  - `theorem prob_assoc : kleisliBind (kleisliBind τ₁ τ₂) τ₃ = kleisliBind τ₁ (kleisliBind τ₂ τ₃)`
  - This is a known result — cite Mathlib or standard reference

### P3.4 — Gate Check

- [ ] 🔴 `lake build` passes with probabilistic extension
- [ ] 🔴 Kleisli associativity proved (no sorry)
- [ ] 🔴 Connection to deterministic case documented

---

## PHASE 4 — Φ as Dependent Type
> Gate: affordance set formalized as dependent type over S₁, composability of Φ proved
> Status: not started
> Estimated effort: 3–6 months (likely requires type theory collaborator)

**What this phase produces:**
Φ as a proper dependent type. Addresses Open Problem 2 (is Φ well-defined
before S₁ is realized?) and Open Problem 4 (does Φ ∘ Φ' hold?).

### P4.1 — Type Theory Setup

- [ ] 🔴 Define affordance set as dependent type
  - `def AffordanceSet : ParadigmaticState → Type`
  - Replace earlier stub with proper dependent formulation

- [ ] 🔴 Define affordance composition
  - `def composeAffordances : AffordanceSet S₁ → AffordanceSet S₂ → AffordanceSet (S₁ ⊗ S₂)`
  - Requires: tensor product of paradigmatic states

- [ ] 🔴 Prove affordance composition is well-typed
  - The type of `Φ ∘ Φ'` depends on the type of the composed state
  - This is the formal content of "Φ is paradigm-specific"

### P4.2 — Effect System Connection

- [ ] 🟡 Map Φ to an effect type system
  - Affordances as computational effects
  - `S₁` as the effect index
  - Allows reuse of Lean 4's effect type machinery

- [ ] 🟡 Study Orchard et al. indexed monad + effect system
  - Their indexed monad tracks effects via type index
  - Φ may be the affordance index playing the same role as effect index

### P4.3 — Open Problem 2 Resolution

- [ ] 🔴 Formally state when Φ is well-defined
  - Pre-realization: Φ is a type-level specification (possible affordances)
  - Post-realization: Φ is a value-level set (actual affordances)
  - Prove these are related by a canonical map

- [ ] 🔴 Document resolution in `proofs/notes.md`

### P4.4 — Gate Check

- [ ] 🔴 `AffordanceSet` is a proper dependent type in Lean
- [ ] 🔴 Open Problem 2 resolved (or formally reduced to a deeper question)
- [ ] 🔴 Open Problem 4 resolved (or formally reduced)

---

## PHASE 5 — Full Mechanized Proof
> Gate: all non-open theorems proved in Lean 4, no sorry remaining
> Status: not started
> Estimated effort: 12–24 months (requires collaborator)

**What this phase produces:**
A mechanically verified proof of the Composable Future theory.
Every theorem in the paper has a corresponding Lean proof.
Open problems either resolved or formally stated as axioms.

### P5.1 — Complete Proof Obligations

- [ ] 🔴 Prove left identity (Phase 1 sorry)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove right identity (Phase 1 sorry)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove closure (Phase 1 sorry)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove or disprove general associativity (Phase 2 outcome)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove non-commutativity of ⊗ (Phase 1 sorry)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove Kleisli associativity (Phase 3 — likely done by P3)
- [ ] 🔴 Prove affordance composition well-typedness (Phase 4 sorry)

### P5.2 — Open Problems Disposition

For each of the 5 open problems, one of:
- Proved in Lean (closes the problem)
- Counterexample found (closes the problem negatively)
- Reduced to known open problem in mathematics (honest deferral)
- Accepted as axiom with justification (honest limitation)

- [ ] 🔴 OP1: Associativity under path-dependent τ — disposition documented
- [ ] 🔴 OP2: Φ well-definedness before S₁ — disposition documented
- [ ] 🔴 OP3: Correct equivalence relation (bisimulation?) — disposition documented
- [ ] 🔴 OP4: Composition of affordance sets Φ ∘ Φ' — disposition documented
- [ ] 🔴 OP5: Completeness (all futures reachable by finite composition) — disposition documented

### P5.3 — Publication

- [ ] 🔴 Full formalization paper — target journal
  - Candidate: *Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra*
  - Or: *Logical Methods in Computer Science*
  - Or: *Applied Categorical Structures*

- [ ] 🟡 ACT conference submission
  - Applied Category Theory conference
  - Check call for papers annually

- [ ] 🟡 Lean proof released on GitHub with paper
  - `lean/` directory becomes the artifact
  - DOI via Zenodo for the codebase separately
